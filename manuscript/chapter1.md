# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Welcome to Zend PHP Certification Study Guide.

I'm Kapil Sharma, Zend certified PHP Engineer. I passed my exam on May 5th, 2014. This guide basically contains the notes I created while studying for Zend PHP Certification. However now, when I'm compiling my notes as a book, I added few more basic level details which I generally skip in my notes.


## Target audiance

As the name suggest, this book is for anyone who are preparing to take Zend PHP certification exam. Even if you are not planning to take the exam, this book is going to help you polish your PHP knowledge. However this if you are learning PHP from scratch, this is not an ideal book for you as I'm not going to cover every basics of PHP. This book assume you have basic level of PHP understanding.
